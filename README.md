# OBJ Image Packer
Takes a Wavefront OBJ with textures and attempts to squash them into a single texture file.

Created for the purpose of packing complex models with multiple textures (such as ripped game models) into a single `.obj` and texture file for use as custom models in [Tabletop Simulator](http://berserk-games.com/tabletop-simulator/).
